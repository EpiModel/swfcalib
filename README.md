`swfcalib` is designed to automate the calibration of complex
multi-parameters multi-outputs models ran on
[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) equipped HPC.

## Specific problems it solves

`swfcalib` was build out of necessity to solve a specific set of
problems:

- very noisy model outputs
- expensive model runs
- many parameters to calibrate
- many outputs to match to their targets
- impossibility of running a pilot job (long running job)
- some knowledge about the parameters and outputs relationship

By using [`slurmworkflow`](https://github.com/EpiModel/slurmworkflow),
`swfcalib` can implement a loop like behavior in
[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) without the need of a pilot job
staying alive for the whole duration of the calibration process
(sometimes several weeks).

`swfcalib` was created to calibrate epidemic models like [this
one](https://github.com/EpiModel/DoxyPEP). These models have around 20
free parameters to calibrate and 20 outcomes to be matched to observed
targets. However, knowledge of the model allow us to define many
conditional one to one relationship between parameters and outcomes.
`swfcalib` can use this knowledge to split the calibration into multiple
waves of simpler parallel calibration jobs.

## Design

The calibration process follows a proposal, validation loop. Where the
model is run with a set of parameters and new proposals are made
according to the results. This goes on until the model is fully
calibrated.

Terminology:

- *model*: a function taking a *proposal* and returning some *outcomes*.
- *proposal*: a set of parameters values to be passed to the *model*
- *outcomes*: the output of a *model* run for a given *proposal*.
- *job*: a set of parameters to be calibrated by using a subset of the
  *outcomes*
- *wave*: a set of independent *jobs* that can be calibrated using the
  same run of the model.

The specificity of `swfcalib` lies in the ability to try many proposal
at once on an HPC, and to set up this proposal validation loop without a
long running orchestrating job (pilot job).

The calibration is split into *waves*. Each wave can contains multiple
*jobs*, each focusing on a set of parameters and related outcomes. This
permits the parallel calibration of multiple independent parameters. At
each *iteration*, the model is ran once per proposal, and each job
gather the outcomes it needs to make its next proposal. Once all *jobs*
in a *wave* are done, i.e.Â the parameters they govern are calibrated,
the system moves to the next *wave*. This allows the sequential
calibration of parameters when strong assumption about their
independence can be made.

This design was crafted for the very noisy models where many
replications are needed and where most parameters are independent or
conditionally independent.

## Versatility

`swfcalib` makes no assumptions on how a set of parameters should be
changed and how the quality of fit is assessed. It is up to the user to
provide the mechanism to:

- produce the next *proposals* to be tested
- assess the quality of the fit

`swfcalib` provides some pre-built functions for this. See the getting
started vignette.
