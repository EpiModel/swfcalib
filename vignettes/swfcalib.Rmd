`swfcalib` gives a scaffold to make an automated calibration system on a
[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) equipped HPC. `swfcalib` relies on
[`slurmworkflow`](https://github.com/EpiModel/slurmworkflow) and a stored
calibration object to chose which step of the calibration to run. This allows
very long calibrations to take place without flooding the `slurm` queue.

`swfcalib` allows the calibration of a *model* where a set of *outcomes* are to
be matched specific *targets*. We specify which *outcome* is governed by what
*parameter* in the *calibration object*.

`swfcalib` defines three simple `slurmworkflow` steps:

1. process the *model* runs *outcomes* and choose what to do next
   - if the calibration is complete, go to step 3
   - if not, make new *parameter* proposals and go to step 2
2. run the *model* with each *parameter* proposals and go back to step 1
3. wrap up the calibration, save the accepted set of *parameters* and all the
   results

## Parameters and Outcomes

In `swfcalib`, *model* is a function that takes a 1 row `tibble` of **all** the
parameters and return a 1 row `tibble` of **all** the outcomes.

However, calibrating all parameters at once with all outcomes at once may not be
the most efficient approach, especially when known independence or conditional
independence exists among parameters and outcomes.

In EpiModelHIV models like [this published
one](https://github.com/EpiModel/CombPrevNet), the portion of individuals
infected by HIV that are diagnosed and the portion of diagnosed that are linked
to care are two independent metrics. They are respectively affected by the
HIV test rate and the rate of treatment linkage.

Therefore, we can calibrate these two parameters on the same set of simulations.

On the other hand, the portion of HIV diagnosed that are virally suppressed
depend on the test rate, linkage to care and retention in care. To calibrate this
last one, we can either Calibrate everything at once, 3 parameters and 3 outcomes.
Doing so is quite hard in our models due to the noisy nature of our results.

The other approach is to calibrate them sequentially. A first wave of
calibration tackles the first two in parallel and a second one the third. This
approach convert one hard and long problem to solve into three simple and quick
one.

A word of caution. This method is very efficient but requires a good
understanding of all the processes at hand to ensure the independence of the
parameters. Fortunately, if such independence does not exists, the final
calibration will be visibly off.

## Calibration Waves, Jobs and Iteration

### Job

Formally, `swfcalib` defines a *job* a set of *parameters* to be calibrated by
trying to make a set of *outcomes* reach a set of *targets*.

Each *job* needs a function to make the next set of *parameter* proposals to
test as well as a function checking if the proposals gave sufficiently good
results. This latter function is in charge of stopping the calibration process
for the current job.

### Wave

A *wave* is a set of multiple jobs that can be run in parallel (i.e.
independent from one another).

In practice, `swfcalib` takes the proposals from all the jobs in a wave, combine
them and run one simulation per proposal. If you have a 3 job wave, each making
10 proposal, only 10 simulations will be run. On the evaluation step, each job
will only assess the quality of it's own outcomes.

Once all the jobs in a wave are finished, the system moves to the next one if
any, using the results of the previous ones.

## Data Structures

### Parameter Proposals

A set of parameter proposals is a `tibble` with 3 mandatory columns:

- `.proposals_index`: the index of the proposal for this iteration
- `.wave`: the number of the current wave
- `.iteration`: the number of the current iteration

plus one column per parameter and each row represent a different unique
proposal.

### Outcomes

A set of outcomes is a `tibble` with 3 mandatory columns:

- `.proposals_index`: the index of the proposal for this iteration
- `.wave`: the number of the current wave
- `.iteration`: the number of the current iteration

plus one column per outcome value and each row represent the outcome from a
specific proposal.

### Results

A set of results is the join of proposals and outcomes. It is a `tibble` with

- all parameter columns
- the three mandatory columns `.proposals_index`, `.wave`, `.iteration`
- all outcome columns
